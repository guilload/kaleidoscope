[Kaleidoscope: Implementing a Language with LLVM in Python](http://www.llvmpy.org/llvmpy-doc/0.12.7/doc/kaleidoscope/index.html)

I haven't followed the tutorial exactly and I've refactored the original code for the most part. To get started:

```sh
python repl.py
```

(Make sure you have LLVM 3.3 and llvmpy installed)
